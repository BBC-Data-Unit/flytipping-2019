In November 2019 **Rob England** [reported on the latest data on fly-tipping](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50330667).

> However, in notes accompanying the statistics the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said councils had "changed the way they capture and report fly-tips over the past few years, so the changes over time should be interpreted with some care."
